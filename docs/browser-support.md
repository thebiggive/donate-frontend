# Big Give Donate Frontend

_Draft_

We want donations to work as widely as possible within the constraints set by our technology partners, unless doing so would compromise
donors' security.

Browsers we expect to work fully with this app are all modern mobile & desktop browsers kept up to date, including extended support
release cycles.

Specifically, we intended to support the browser versions that we have recently seen people donating with, in addition to all more commonly
used and up-to-date browsers. Supported browsers are:

- Chrome (Desktop and Android) 107 (released in October 2022) and later
- Edge 107 (Released in October 2022) and later
- Firefox 104, Desktop and Android (Released in October 2022) and later
- Safari 15 (Desktop and iOS released September 2021) and later

Supporting a browser means that in developing and maintaining any features that are important parts of using our site we will endeavour to test with and
ensure that they work on all those browsers. However, some bugs will inevitably appear, so users may still want to try an alternate browser as a work-around
if they do encounter a bug when using one of our supported browsers.

We may also need to specify operating system versions to add detail above, particularly in the case of iOS.

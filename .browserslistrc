# Chrome 67 seems fine with vite, 61 crashes it. So somewhere in this range will probably be our Android/Chrome baseline.
# TODO work out how far back we can go.
# TODO if we're not 100% happy with the Android answer, test having these 2 diverge again and see if we really need old desktop Chrome
# in range to support old Android Chrome.
